# OpenTelemetry with NestJS
> This is a learning repository, none of the code found here should be directly adopted for production, without passing through a code-review process.

This repository stores all the learning artifacts developed during the exploration of OpenTelemetry JavaScript's SDK. The main purpose here is to display a few ways of integration with those functionalities and how they could be used in a NestJS project.

## Running the Project
Since this is a learning repository, the best way to explore is running it inside a DevContainer. The project has a configuration file, along with multiple Docker'ish configuration files. To run, simply:
`Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) > "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"`.

Inside the DevContainer, the application could be executed with:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
